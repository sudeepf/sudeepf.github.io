						My major contributions and interests
						</font></br> are in application oriented extensions of:
					</a></br>
					&emsp; &bull; Artificial Intelligence </br>
					&emsp; &bull; Computer Vision </br>
					&emsp; &bull; Deep Learning </br>
					&emsp; &bull; Robotics </br>
					&emsp; &bull; Image Processing </br>
					&emsp; &bull; Computational Perception </br>
					&emsp; &bull; Vision-based Human Machine Interaction. </br>

					Last summer, I did my internship with Uber Advanced Technologies Group in Pittsburgh, where I ideated, prototyped, developed, evaluated and then deployed a real-time scene understanding module for Uber's current self-driving vehicle fleet. 
					These module played a very critical role in extending the capabilities of autonomous vehicles.
					
					Before attending Carnegie Mellon, I was a research engineer at Uurmi systems, where in conjunction with my undergraduate lab(RRC) and led a team of 22 people developing in-house low-cost self-driving car technology. There I spent my time in developing end-to-end system architecture and real-time modules for stereo reconstruction, segmentation, prediction, a parallel framework for mapping, visual odometry, Kalman fusion for localization, and global and local path planning. I also worked on embedded vision projects such as real-time stereo camera calibration and rectification and embedded vision on FPGAs and low-power processors.

					At Carnegie Mellon, I have been working with Dr. Deva and Dr. Katerina on 3D Human pose estimation from a monocular image (sponsored by Amazon Lab126). This involves an end-to-end deep learning method to estimate pose in volumetric representation.

						Background:
					</font>
					</a></br>
					Before joining Uurmi Systems, I was actively involved in the Robotics Research Center of IIIT Hyderabad as a Researcher and Teaching Assistant under Dr. K Madhava Krishna. </br>
					During this time I have worked intensively on:</br>
					&emsp;  &bull; Human-Robot Interaction </br>
					&emsp;  &bull; Real time dense-3D reconstruction and obstacle detection from stereo images </br>
					&emsp;  &bull; Control Theory </br>
					&emsp;  &bull; Exploration, Path Planning and Navigation </br>
					&emsp;  &bull; Detection and Tracking </br>
					I have also worked in domains like:</br>
					&emsp;  &bull; FPGA based vision processing </br>
					&emsp;  &bull; EKF based pose estimation</br>
					&emsp;  &bull; Path Planning with optimization framework,  </br>
					&emsp;  &bull; Mechanical Design (SolidWorks) and Simulation(Adams)
 </br>
					&emsp;  &bull; Embedded circuits</br>

					About Me:
					</font></br>
					I like to work in a challenging environment demanding all my skills and efforts, to explore and adapt to different fields, so I get the opportunity to learn and grow continuously.</br>I like giving my knowledge back to the society that has nourished me; I actively write tutorials for students on development tools like <b>OpenCV</b>, Robot Operating System<b>(ROS)</b>, Point Cloud Library<b>(PCL)</b> etc. I also like contributing to the opensource community whenever I get time by answering few doubts of fellow developers (ROS-Answer profile).
