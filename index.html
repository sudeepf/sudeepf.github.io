					I have been working in conjunction with both my undergraduate lab(RRC) and Uurmi Systems on collaborative joint projects. I currently <b>lead a team of 22 members</b> for an <u>Autonomous Driverless Car</u> project, where we are developing a low cost solution for safe navigation in cluttered urban environments, like Indian city roads, by using only cameras as the main perception sensors. My team has more than 50 man years of experience in R&D robotics, with PhD, Masters and B.Tech holding members, and has nearly 65 publications cumulatively in this area.
